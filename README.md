# Minesweeper

Please run this file to start the game. The number of rows, columns, and mines 
that are produced can be adjusted through the bigBang method at the bottom of 
the file. However, there is a limit. Rows and columns must be between 10 and 50,
while the number of mines cannot exceed the number of cells produced. Once started,
the game increments points by 50 for every cell (that is not a mine) that is 
revealed. If a mine is clicked, you will be shown a screen telling you that 
you lost. If all non-mine cells are revealed, click once more on the board to
reveal a "win" message. In both cases, you will be shown your final score.
Lastly, you can flag cells that you think are mines by right clicking on the cell.
